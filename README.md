## Collect user data in google sheets (instead of DB)

A script (more like a function that can be used in any node.js env) to store data in google spreadsheets. 

Can be used as a quick hack where we don't need DB but want to collect some user data. (or migrate existing data to sheets)

This example is hard coded. Modify the script and data/input as per your use case.


#### How to run?

```
1. Create a .env file 
2. Store your sheet api_key and email_id inside the .env file
3. Run spreadsheet.js using node

// the concept can be extended to work on cliend-side

```
